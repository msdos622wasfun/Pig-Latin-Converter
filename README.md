# Pig-Latin-Converter
 Small tool to convert normal English into Pig Latin.

This is a program written in PowerBASIC that attempts to convert normal English into Pig Latin.

Basically you feed it some input (it's a command line tool), and it spits out the conversion as best as it can.  The algorithm I came up with might not be perfect, but overall it does a good job.

If you have any suggestions which might make the translation process even better, I'd love to hear from you.
